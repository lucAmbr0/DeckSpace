##  :beginner: About
This repository houses a web application designed to facilitate interactive exploration of various array sorting algorithms. With a focus on educational utility, users can simulate sorting methods such as bubble sort, quick sort, and more, gaining both technical insight and visual comprehension. The interface is carefully crafted for ease of use, providing a pleasant user experience. Notably, the application is highly customizable, allowing users to tweak parameters of both arrays and sorting methods. Built exclusively with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the absence of frameworks ensures simplicity and accessibility, making it an ideal resource for those seeking to delve into the intricacies of sorting algorithms without unnecessary complexity. Whether accessed through a browser or installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on Android devices, this repository offers a valuable tool for understanding and experimenting with array sorting techniques.

## :zap: Usage
Key features include:

Customizable Interface: Personalize the UI/UX to create a clean and tailored experience that fits your gameplay style.
Card Management: Add, remove, and organize cards effortlessly with a minimalistic interface. The mirrored display ensures that cards are easy to read from all sides of the table.
Chip/Betting System: Optional currency mode enables players to track bets and manage chips with full-screen animations, adding transparency to gameplay.
Offline & Flexible: DeckSpace is completely offline, letting players decide the rules of the game, which cards to use, and how to play.
Shareable Settings: Save and share your custom settings as a simple code string so all players can quickly sync their configuration for the game.
DeckSpace is ideal for card enthusiasts who want a sleek, digital card-playing experience without the limitations of specific card games or complicated setups.

###  :electric_plug: Installation
You can get this app in many ways.
* Since this app now follows the guidelines to be installed as PWA (Progressive Web App) you can open this app from the github pages link (on top of this page) and then accept the prompt to install or if it doesn't appear for any reason click the three dots on the top-right of your browser and tap "Install App" to get the WebApp available in your Android smartphone. This way usually offers a better experience. You will automatically get most of the updates remotely and you won't need to be connected to the internet to use it normally.
* Otherwise you can always use the link to connect to github pages. Your data is saved in the browser's local storage, so it will always stay on your phone.
* I also plan to make an actual apk application for android using a PWA builder service in the future.

## :question: FAQ
* **Is DeckSpace multiplayer?** <br>
No, DeckSpace is currently designed for offline use only. It allows players to manage cards and chips on their own devices without needing a network connection.

* **Can I customize the cards and layout?** <br>
Yes! DeckSpace offers a wide range of customization options for both the cards and the user interface. You can tailor the app’s appearance and functionality to match your preferences and even share your settings with friends.

At the moment, DeckSpace does not have a game-saving feature. It is designed to help players manage cards and chips during a game session, but the history and state of the game are not stored between sessions.

Absolutely! We welcome feature suggestions and bug reports. Feel free to open an issue on GitHub, and we’ll review your input as we continue to improve DeckSpace!
